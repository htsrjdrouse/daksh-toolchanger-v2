I am trying to figure out how to run this code and am providing some notes as I get a handle of this. There are some tool differences between the original daksh design and my version namely the optical probe sensor will be used used but instead use a detachable probe but this could still use the same pin, also (just because I accidently purchased the EBB42 instead of the EBB36), the pin designation will be different in some cases since I also am using EBB36 too. Also, instead of 4 tools, I am just going to use 2. 

1. One of the things you need to do when installing this is that you need to move the files in the modules folder into  ~/klipper/klippy/extras/, not moving the modules directory and subdirectories, but the files in the directory/subdirectories. 
2. If you use less or more tools then just 4 (in my case I am using 2), then you need to make sure you indicate that. I am not sure in what areas of the code this needs to be done. So here is a list of areas that may need to be modified:
  a. In toolchange_management.cfg, you have this code
<code>
[gcode_macro CYCLE_ALL_TOOLS]
gcode:
     SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=STORE_TOOLHEAD_POSITION VARIABLE=bypass_toolhead_position VALUE=1
     T0
     T1
     T2 <- delete
     T3 <- delete
     T4 <- delete
     INITIALIZE_TOOL_USE_COUNT
     T{params.FINAL_TOOL}
     SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=STORE_TOOLHEAD_POSITION VARIABLE=bypass_toolhead_position VALUE=0
</code>
