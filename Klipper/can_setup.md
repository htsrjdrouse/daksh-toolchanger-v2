# CAN setup #

CAN makes it straightforward to add more devices. This is done by using an ethernet cable that has twisted pair cables, one of which is used for the CAN connection (High and Low) and the others are grouped (3 for the 24V and the other 3 grouped for ground. 

The recipe for setting up the firmware for both the BTT EBB36 and EBB42 CAN device boards and the CAN bus adaptor (BTT U2C v2.1) are derived from KB3d - https://wiki.kb-3d.com/
