##Testing loading accuracy##

I wanted to see how accurate the loading and unloading is and used the nudge tool (https://github.com/zruncho3d/nudge/tree/main). When first using this tool, I made some mistakes first I installed it upside down then maybe I didn't tighten the screws sufficiently to get a good electrical connection.
