<b>Daksh modifications</b>

This version has a few modifications which were made in order to get it to work. The CAD design was modified using OpenScad and the code is included. Here is a list of various modifications:

1. Dock is modified so that it is rigid and accomodates the guide pins that adhere to the 2 in 1 rule for linear motion. The extruder assembly has been modified as well to match. There are more magnets to better secure the docking. 
2. Most (almost all) heat inserts have been replaced with self tapping holes.
3. Hall sensors have been replaced using mechanical endstops. This simplifies the wiring. 
4. The extruder has been redesigned to work with Bambu Labs hotend.
5. The z probe feature inside the extruder has been removed.
6. The maxwell coupling acorn nuts and mgn12 rails are 3-D printed.
7. The top rear extruder plate that secures the stepper motor has been redesigned that allows for better wiring organization.
8. Adjustable ooze wipes and adapted voron style spool holders
