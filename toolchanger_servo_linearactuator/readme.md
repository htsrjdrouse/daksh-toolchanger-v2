Before working on this toolchanger project, I was focused on modifying 3D printers to function as liquid handlers for a laboratory automation applications. While doing this, I developed a tube loading/filling application that was apart of a nucleic acid detection assay which I documented <a href=https://www.htsresources.com/posts/Nucleic_acid_detection_PCR_Taqman_Probe_modified_3D_Printer/index.php> https://www.htsresources.com/posts/Nucleic_acid_detection_PCR_Taqman_Probe_modified_3D_Printer/index.php</a>. 

My interest with toolchangers is to create a "swiss army knife" of use case applications and I want to port over this application as being my first attempt to expand its utility. So I created a combined nozzle mount and linear actuator for the purposes of loading and unloading pipette tips. I haven't tested this design yet. While the original design employed a 8 pipette multichannel, this project involves focusing on a single nozzle.
